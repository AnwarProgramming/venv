To create a virtual environment in Python using the terminal, follow these steps:

1. Open your terminal.
2. Navigate to your project directory.
3. Run the following command to create a virtual environment:

```sh
python -m venv myenv
```

Replace `myenv` with the name you want for your virtual environment.

4. To activate the virtual environment, run the following command:

On Windows:
```sh
myenv\Scripts\activate
```

On macOS and Linux:
```sh
source myenv/bin/activate
```




3. **Install Requirements**:
    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4. **Check for Specific Errors**: If the error persists, look at the specific error message to identify which package is causing the issue. You can try installing that package individually to get more detailed error information:
    ```sh
    pip install flask
    pip install flask_sqlalchemy
    pip install jinja
    pip install flask_wtf
    ```

GitHub Copilot: To install the packages listed in your requirements.txt file, follow these steps:

1. **Ensure Virtual Environment is Activated**: Make sure you have activated your virtual environment. If not, activate it using the following command:

   On Windows:
   ```sh
   myenv\Scripts\activate
   ```

   On macOS and Linux:
   ```sh
   source myenv/bin/activate
   ```

2. **Install Requirements**: Run the following command to install the packages listed in your requirements.txt file:

   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

This command will read the requirements.txt file and install all the listed packages into your virtual environment.
